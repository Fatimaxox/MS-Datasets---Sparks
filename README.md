# MS Datasets Repository

Welcome to the MS Datasets Repository!  <br>
This repository is dedicated to showcasing datasets used in both segmentation and classification problems related to Multiple Sclerosis (MS). 
Here, researchers and individuals interested in MS can easily access various datasets containing MRI images.

## MS Classification

For classification, a local Saudi dataset obtained from King Fahad Specialists Hospital was utilized. A total of 229 patients participated, with MRI orientation covering Brain (Axial, Coronal, Sagittal) and Spinal cord. The MRI sequences included T1, T2, and FLAIR.

Additionally, other resources were utilized:

- Normal cases taken from [Brain Tumor MRI Images - 17 Classes](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fernando2rad/brain-tumor-mri-images-17-classes?select=NORMAL+T2) with 50 samples taken from T1, T2.
- Not MS cases from [Brain Tumor MRI Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset?select=Testing) with 263 samples for the 3 types of human.
